# 02 CSS and Bootstrap: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

## Directions from assignment

First, use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio with the following guidelines:

- Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.
- Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

  - A navbar
  - A responsive layout (using its grid system with containers, rows, and columns)
  - Responsive images

- The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries. (On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.)
- Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

- Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

- Submit on BCS
  - The URLs of the deployed applications
  - The URLs of the GitHub repositories

### Minimum Requirements

- Functional, deployed application
- GitHub repository with README describing the project
- Navbar must be consistent on each page.
- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
- All links must work.
- Must use semantic html.
- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)
- Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)
- Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

## Narrative on steps taken.

- Setup GitHub Repo to start uploading commits for back up and live view.
- HTMLs are initially set up for bootstrap CSS (may look into JS if there's time).
- HTMLs got nav bars with active links, sections set up and started playing with format for aesthetics.
- Added local styles.css to global styles.
- enriched portfolio, added bootstrap container for gridding system and used cards.
- revised container, refined all htmls with with and added rows to enable gridding all across.
- Refined and merged some card features to aesthetically control content in within "cell"
